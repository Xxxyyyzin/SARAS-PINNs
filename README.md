# SARAS-PINNs

This repository contains the source code for **SARAS-PINNs**, a structure-aware and residual-gradient-adaptive sampling framework for physics-informed neural network (PINN) based seismic traveltime modeling. The code implements structure-initialized and residual-gradient-adaptive sampling strategies to improve training efficiency and prediction accuracy in complex velocity models. 
Users can reproduce the results reported in our manuscript and adapt the framework for other PDE-based modeling tasks.
